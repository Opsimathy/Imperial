Part 1

1. 
Good description of the methods. Analysis of cost is correct.
() You are asked to provide the cost for solving the given problem, 
so the dependence of the cost on m should be considered here, not later in the question.

Score:  4/4
-------------
2.

Good 
(-0.5) Though you should be careful with your wording and description. Saying " and vice versa" with 2 dependents 
n or m, small or large... its confusing. Also " et because log n is
negligible as long as n is not too large" what do you mean by this? if n >> 1 then nlog(n) vs log n
are distinct? Again you say vice verse but m and n fixed!?!

(-1) How do we know from your graph 
that they follow the correct relationships?  You should check if the dependence of cost on n is 
consistent with your analysis from question 1 and carefully consider the influence of m
You should use loglog plots and polyfit or something similar 
to carefully investigate this.
(-1.5) The comparison of the two methods could have gone into greater depth about
how m and n simultaneously affect the relative performance drawing upon your cost 
estimates For full marks you should consider non-trivial relationships, such as m and n changing together etc. 


Score:  3/6
-------------
Part 2 
(a)  
 
  Code is correct, however naive pattern search is not an efficient 
  approach for this problem (-3)

Score:  3/6 
-------------
(b) 
 
 Analysis of time complexity is not correct as the cost of direct string 
 comparison is O(m). (-1) Additionally, no discussion of the efficiency has 
 been given (-1)
